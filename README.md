### Tip Calculator

### Summary: I built a tip calculator in next.js using tailwindCss and components. I needed a fair bit of help with the useeffect's and properly formattting the assignment, but other than that it was a good challenge.

### Peer Review: Looks good, the colors are right and the layout is very close the functionality is good, the font isnt working but can be fixed. It is also responsive
